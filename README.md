# AstroWeightAngular

This is one of the first JavaScript projects I have ever worked on. This project really put into perspective how to use and manipulate arrays. The idea behind this application is to let the user enter their weight ,the user then can choose a planet to choose from and it will calculate what your weight would be on that planet. This project was initially written with plain vanilla Javascript and a little bit of jQuery, but I managed to recreate it in Angular.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.


## Development server

npm start will run ng serve
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
